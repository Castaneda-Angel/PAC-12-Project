# PAC-12-Project

Code that would've been written differently without a time constraint
- Network manager

Something that isnâ€™t working properly but how it would be resolved given more time.
- Cells only showing one sport, if there are multiple sports I add a "+ 'num'" at the end to signify, but there are better solutions for this.
- Tapping video thumbnail to play video only, currently any tap on the cell will play video.

Some more details in code comments!
